# UnitConverter - Java

Hi All,

I'm just getting into programming, and I'd love any kind of constructive criticism.
I'm starting with a simple unit converter, planning to make it more and more complex as I go.
I'm sure that I'm doing many things inefficiently, or missing some error exceptions, or various other errors, so please comment.

Thanks,

Jason
